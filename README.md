# Analysis-of-Regional-Traffice-count-of-National-Capital-Region
Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments has organized and published annual average daily traffic by vehicle classifications for the National Capital Region. The suggested dataset for this Challenge represents the average hourly traffic counts between 6 and 9 A.M. in a typical 2017 weekday. As the regional transportation planning organization, we are interested in knowing what can be told about the traffic conditions of the morning rush hours in the Capital Region. We used ARCGIS to create map visualization and finding traffic patterns. This project is a part of UMD Data Challenge 2020.
